## Monique Geany Theme

This is a modified version of the [Base16 Monokai Dark](http://github.com/robloach/base16-geany) theme by Rob Loach made
for the [Geany](http://www.geany.org/) code editor.

There are no major changes. I have mainly made the comments a bit lighter colour, and made the whitespace characters and
indent guides more visible.
